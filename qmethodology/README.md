# Q-Methodology

Arguments: 28 statements, 14 Q-sorts, “FALSE” forced distribution, 4 factors, 
varimax rotation, automatic flagging and Pearson correlation coefficient. 

LOA-Factor loadings for Q-sorts. Indicates the relationship between each Q-sort 
and component or factor (using “varimax” rotation function).

NOTE: Bold numbers (>0.5) are the Q-sorts (rows) related with that factor (columns).

Plot. The following plot shows the statements ordered by the standard deviation
 of z-scores for the 4 factors, comparing the z-scores of all factors. The statements
 with the largest consensus are at the bottom where the distances among the factors are shorter
 (3, 27, 24, 21, 11, 14, 1 and 26). The statements with the largest differences between factors
 are at the top where all points are distant.
